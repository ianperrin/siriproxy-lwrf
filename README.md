SiriProxy LightwaveRF Controller
================================
About
-----
A Plugin for [Siri Proxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) to send commands to LightwaveRF devices via a LightwaveRF Wifi Link.

Prerequisites
------------
* A [Siri capable device](http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/siri-faq/) â€“ currently that includes the iPhone 4S or newer, the iPad 4th generation or the iPad Mini
* A [Siri Proxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) server
* The [LightwaveRF Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/lightwaverf/) - this is installed automatically when installing this plugin.
* One of more [LightwaveRF devices](http://www.lightwaverf.com/product-range) and a [LightwaveRF WiFi Link](http://amzn.to/YPnRjZ)!

#### Important Notes 
* This plugin **does not** require a Jailbreak and any settings made can be fully reversed/uninstalled if required.
* This plugin is neither developed, nor endorsed by lightwaverf.com, do not contact them about problems or issues you encounter with this plugin. If you're having problems with the plugin, open an issue on github.

Installation
------------

Install SiriProxy. Some instructions for doing this on a RaspberryPi can be found here: http://www.hometoys.com/emagazine/2013/02/siri-home-automation-integration-from-start-to-finish-brpart-2--raspberry-pi-installation/2090

Edit the SiriProxy config file (`~/.siriproxy/config.yml`) so that it contains the following lines, e.g.

    - name: 'Lwrf'
      git: 'git://github.com/ianperrin/siriproxy-lwrf.git'

To support the ability to update rooms and devices from the LightwaveRF servers, add the `lwrfemail` and `lwrfpin` options to the SiriProxy config file (`~/.siriproxy/config.yml`), e.g.

    - name: 'Lwrf'
      git: 'git://github.com/ianperrin/siriproxy-lwrf.git'
      lwrfemail: 'email@example.com'
      lwrfpin: '1234'

To view debug information, set the debug option to true in the SiriProxy config file (`~/.siriproxy/config.yml`), e.g.

    - name: 'Lwrf'
      git: 'git://github.com/ianperrin/siriproxy-lwrf.git'
      debug: true 

Re-bundle SiriProxy, e.g.

	cd ~/SiriProxy
	rvmsudo siriproxy bundle
	rvmsudo bundle install
	rvmsudo siriproxy server

Test the plugin by saying the following command:

	"Test Lightwave"

Siri should respond by saying something like:

	"LightWave is in my control!"

Siri should also display the path of the [LightwaveRF Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/lightwaverf/) config file, e.g.

	"LightWave is in my control using the config file ~/root/lightwaverf-config.yml"

Use this path to edit the config file so that it contains the correct host, rooms and devices for your LightwaveRF setup, e.g.

	sudo nano ~/root/lightwaverf-config.yml

If you have uploaded your LightwaveRF database to the server and set the `lwrfemail` and `lwrfpin` options in the SiriProxy config file, your rooms and devices configuration can be automatically updated by saying the following command:

	"Update my Lightwave data"

Usage
-----

* Turn 'on' the 'light' in the 'lounge'
* Turn 'on' the 'lounge' 'light'
